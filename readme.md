**A simple, powerful SEC Query API**

## Background
EDGAR database contains a wealth of information about the Commission and the securities industry which is freely available to the public. Information such as quarterly and yearly analysis of a public traded company, major share holders of a company, insider sells and buys etc, can be found in the filings of EDGAR database. It gives investors the ability to assess a company's history and progress, as well as make reasonable assumptions about its future through studying these filings.

## Features
* Filing Index API: retrieve filing meta information for company filing documents.  
Example: A simple call gets historical 10-Q form filing information by Apple between 2008-01-01 and 2010-01-01 in json format.

* Filings API: to query the content of filing documents, this call gets the 13F-HR forms that filed between 2019-07-01 and 2019-09-01 and contains MongoDB in its holdings in json format.  
This API currently only supports 13H-HR from 2019-01-01 to 2019-10-01 form content query, and can be extended to other types of forms in the future.

* This API also provides user friendly web interface

## Technical challenge
1. System scalability
Use Python Celery to set up distributed computing cluster for high work load. Computing capability can be scaled up horizontally by add more Celery workers.
1. Extensibility
EdgarMangers module allow users to add customized parsers to process filing documents. (For implementation details, please check readme in EdgarManagers module)
1. High data accuracy (future plan)  
Add retries for transient failures in MySQL
Add NoSQL database as source of truth for ElasticSearch
